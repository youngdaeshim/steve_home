  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript
    has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[12] and major web browsers
    have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but
    the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.
